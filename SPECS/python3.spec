# For a very long time we have converted "upstream architecture names" to "Fedora names".
# This made sense at the time, see https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/687#issuecomment-666362947
# However, with manylinux wheels popularity growth, this is now a problem.
# Wheels built on a Linux that doesn't do this were not compatible with ours and vice versa.
# We now have a compatibility layer to workaround a problem,
# but we also no longer use the legacy arch names in Fedora 34+.
# This bcond controls the behavior. The defaults should be good for anybody.

# Notes from bootstraping Python 3.6
# ==================================
#
# New Python major version (3.X) break ABI and bytecode compatibility,
# so all packages depending on it need to be rebuilt.
#
# Due to a dependency cycle between Python, gdb, rpm, pip, setuptools, wheel,
# and other packages, this isn't straightforward.
# Build in the following order:
#
# 1. At the same time:
#     - gdb without python support (add %%global _without_python 1 on top of
#       gdb's SPEC file)
#     - python-rpm-generators with bootstrapping_python set to 1
#       (this can be done also during step 2., but should be done before 3.)
# 2. python3 without rewheel (use %%bcond_with rewheel instead of
#     %%bcond_without)
# 3. At the same time:
#     - gdb with python support (remove %%global _without_python 1 on top of
#       gdb's SPEC file)
#     - python-rpm-generators with bootstrapping_python set to 0
#       (this can be done at any later step without negative effects)
# 4. rpm
# 5. python-setuptools with bootstrap set to 1
# 6. python-pip with build_wheel set to 0
# 7. python-wheel with %%bcond_without bootstrap
# 8. python-setuptools with bootstrap set to 0 and also with_check set to 0
# 9. python-pip with build_wheel set to 1
# 10. pyparsing
# 11. python3 with rewheel
#
# Then the most important packages have to be built, in dependency order.
# These were:
#   python-sphinx, pytest, python-requests, cloud-init, dnf, anaconda, abrt
#
# After these have been built, a targeted rebuild should be done for the rest.

# Support OpenSSL FIPS mode
# - Fallback implementations md5, sha1, sha256, sha512 are removed in favor of OpenSSL wrappers
# - In FIPS mode, OpenSSL wrappers are always used in hashlib
# - add a new "usedforsecurity" keyword argument to the various digest
#   algorithms in hashlib so that you can whitelist a callsite with
#   "usedforsecurity=False"
#   The change has been implemented upstream since Python 3.9:
#   https://bugs.python.org/issue9216
# - OpenSSL wrappers for the hashes blake2{b512,s256},
#     sha3_{224,256,384,512}, shake_{128,256} are now exported from _hashlib
# - In FIPS mode, the blake2, sha3 and shake hashes use OpenSSL wrappers
#   and do not offer extended functionality (keys, tree hashing, custom digest size)
# - In FIPS mode, hmac.HMAC can only be instantiated with an OpenSSL wrapper
#   or an string with OpenSSL hash name as the "digestmod" argument.
#   The argument must be specified (instead of defaulting to ‘md5’).
#
# - Also while in FIPS mode, we utilize OpenSSL's DRBG and disable the
#   os.getrandom() function.

# Original names for architectures with different names downstream
#
# https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Python_Upstream_Architecture_Names
#
# Pythons in RHEL/Fedora used different names for some architectures
# than upstream and other distros (for example ppc64 vs. powerpc64).
# This was patched in patch 274, now it is sedded if %%with legacy_archnames.
#
# That meant that an extension built with the default upstream settings
# (on other distro or as an manylinux wheel) could not been found by Python
# on RHEL/Fedora because it had a different suffix.
# This patch adds the legacy names to importlib so Python is able
# to import extensions with a legacy architecture name in its
# file name.
# It work both ways, so it support both %%with and %%without legacy_archnames.
#
# WARNING: This patch has no effect on Python built with bootstrap
# enabled because Python/importlib_external.h is not regenerated
# and therefore Python during bootstrap contains importlib from
# upstream without this feature. It's possible to include
# Python/importlib_external.h to this patch but it'd make rebasing
# a nightmare because it's basically a binary file.

# gh-95778: CVE-2020-10735: Prevent DoS by very large int() (GH-96504)
#
# Converting between `int` and `str` in bases other than 2
# (binary), 4, 8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base 10 (decimal) now
# raises a `ValueError` if the number of digits in string form is above a
# limit to avoid potential denial of service attacks due to the algorithmic
# complexity. This is a mitigation for CVE-2020-10735
# (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10735).
#
# This new limit can be configured or disabled by environment variable, command
# line flag, or :mod:`sys` APIs. See the `Integer String Conversion Length
# Limitation` documentation.  The default limit is 4300
# digits in string form.
#
# Patch by Gregory P. Smith [Google] and Christian Heimes [Red Hat] with feedback
# from Victor Stinner, Thomas Wouters, Steve Dower, Ned Deily, and Mark Dickinson.
#
# Notes on the backport to Python 3.6 in RHEL:
#
# * Use "Python 3.6.8-48" version in the documentation, whereas this
#   version will never be released
# * Only add _Py_global_config_int_max_str_digits global variable:
#   Python 3.6 doesn't have PyConfig API (PEP 597) nor _PyRuntime.
# * sys.flags.int_max_str_digits cannot be -1 on Python 3.6: it is
#   set to the default limit. Adapt test_int_max_str_digits() for that.
# * Declare _PY_LONG_DEFAULT_MAX_STR_DIGITS and
#   _PY_LONG_MAX_STR_DIGITS_THRESHOLD macros in longobject.h but only
#   if the Py_BUILD_CORE macro is defined.
# * Declare _Py_global_config_int_max_str_digits in pydebug.h.

This package contains the header files and configuration needed to compile

It also contains the necessary macros to build RPM packages with Python modules
and 2to3 tool, an automatic source converter from Python 2.X.

It also makes the "python3" and "python3-config" commands available
for compatibility with some build systems.
When building packages, prefer requiring platform-python-devel and using
the %%{__python3} macro instead, if possible.

%description -n platform-python-debug
python3-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues and other bugs.

The bytecode format is unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between
this and the standard version of Python, but the debugging features mean that
C/C++ extension modules are ABI-incompatible and must be built for each version
separately.

The debug build shares installation directories with the standard Python
runtime, so that .py and .pyc files can be shared.
Compiled extension modules use a special ABI flag ("d") in the filename,
so extensions for both versions can co-exist in the same directory.

patch 110 (upstreamed expat fix), patch 111 (parallel build fix for grammar
fixed upstream)

- drop our configuration patch to Setup.dist (patch 0): setup.py should do a
better job of things, and the %%files explicitly lists our modules (r82746
appears to break the old way of doing things).  This leads to various modules
changing from "foomodule.so" to "foo.so".  It also leads to the optimized build
dropping the _sha1, _sha256 and _sha512 modules, but these are provided by
_hashlib; _weakref becomes a builtin module; xxsubtype goes away (it's only for
testing/devel purposes)

* Mon May 24 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.1.2-6
- build and install two different configurations of Python 3: debug and
standard, packaging the debug build in a new "python3-debug" subpackage
(patch 103)

* Tue Apr 13 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.1.2-5

- move the -gdb.py file from %%{_libdir}/INSTSONAME-gdb.py to
%%{_prefix}/lib/debug/%%{_libdir}/INSTSONAME.debug-gdb.py to avoid noise from

debuginfo subpackage, rather than the libs subpackage
- introduce %%{py_SOVERSION} and %%{py_INSTSONAME} to reflect the upstream
configure script, and to avoid fragile scripts that try to figure this out
dynamically (e.g. for the -gdb.py change)

* Mon Feb  8 2010 David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com> - 3.1.1-23

than libncurses.so), rather than within the Makefile; add a test to %%install
to verify the dso files that the curses module is linked against the correct

- update patch0's setup of the crypt module to link it against libcrypt
- update patch0 to comment "datetimemodule" back out, so that it is built
